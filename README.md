# GroceryList

This is a project I completed while a student at Hack Reactor.
I copied the project from a different file due to technical conflicts.

Requirements of the project:
- Adding items to the grocery list
- Removing items from the grocery list
- Edit entries of the grocery list
- Change the order of the grocery list
- Store current and historical list data in a SQL database
